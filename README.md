Java dependency vulnerability scanner - v0.0.1 (hacky edition)

Based on the www.victi.ms project maintained by RedHat Security

This program will take in your GitHub credentials via the command line, and find all pom.xml files in your account. Then it feeds those POMs through the victi.ms database via an embedded victims client. Results are returned on stdout.
